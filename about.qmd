My name is Aria Whalen! I use she/her pronouns.

I am a Biology Major with Concentrations in Statistics + Data Science and Environmental Studies. I am an RA in Mellby hall, I work at STOGROW (St. Olaf's Farm), I work in the ceramic studio, and I work as an R-Star for the bio department!

My favorite animal is the snake :)
